1. **negotiating never makes (worthwhile) offers worse**    
2. This also means you do not start negotiating until you already have a Yes-If. (Yes-If we agree on terms). 
This means that any discussion of compensation prior to hearing Yes-If is premature.  If you’re still at the job interview and you’re talking price you are doing something wrong.  
(Read the room: it is entirely possible that you came for a job interview, finished it, and proceeded directly to a salary negotiation.  
That’s probably suboptimal, but it is OK.  Just don’t give the employer the option of having the schedule be job interview,
 salary negotiation, and back to job interview if they discover that you have a spine.)     
3. The First Rule Is What Everyone Tells You It Is: Never Give A Number First       
“But Patrick,” you cry.  “I don’t want to be difficult.”  You’re not being difficult.  You’re not doing anything immoral.  You’re not being unprofessional.     




1. Research the market and salary trends
2. Consider giving a salary range, not a number
From what I know about the position, I think somewhere in the area of $XX – $XX
I want this move to be a big step forward for me in terms of both responsibility and compensation.
3. Diplomatically turn the question around
- I’d like to learn more about the position and the duties, and what the team’s like, before discussing money. But may I ask what salary range you’re considering for this position?
- If the employer’s salary range is in the area you were considering, or even higher, thank them for sharing the information and confirm that the figure’s in your ballpark. If it’s a little less, say it’s at the lower end of what you were hoping for, but you’d still like to talk about the job.
- If the employer is starting at a much lower range than your desired compensation, then say so and ask whether the figures would be adjusted for the right hire. Don’t waste your time or the employer’s if it’s clear from the start that you won’t reach an agreement on salary.
4. Now it’s time to give a number, not a range
- "Given the responsibilities of the position and the number of people I’d be managing, I think $XX is a fair figure. It’s an exciting opportunity, and I truly believe I’m the person for the job."
- "I’m really excited by the challenges you described! $XX seems like the right starting salary. There’s a lot to take on, and I’m confident I’d succeed in the role."
- "I’m thinking $XX. This is a big job — one I’m very familiar with and well suited for. I led a similar team at my past employer, and we hit all the goals we were charged with. I’d be very excited to take on another challenge like this!"
- "I remember the salary range you gave me earlier, and I respect the fact that you have to work within a budget. But I’d like to suggest $XX as the starting salary. The responsibilities of this role are quite demanding, and as we’ve both said, I have all the necessary skills and training. I believe I can deliver the results you said you’re looking for."
- I’m not really comfortable sharing that information. I would prefer to focus on the value I can add to this company and not what I’m paid at my current job.
- Keep it positive and friendly. Be confident and polite.
5. Always be truthful

Q. So where are you right now in terms of salary, and what are your salary expectations if you make this move?
A. I’m not comfortable sharing my current salary. I would prefer to focus on the value I can add to this company rather than what I’m paid at my current job. I don’t have a specific number in mind for a desired salary, and you know better than I do what value my skillset and experience could bring to your company. I want this move to be a big step forward for me in terms of both responsibility and compensation.


- Here’s your trump card for the salary expectations question
“I’m not comfortable sharing my current employer’s proprietary compensation information, and I know they wouldn’t appreciate it if I did. I still work for them, and I’m just not comfortable sharing their proprietary information about how they pay people like me. I really don’t have a specific number in mind for an expected salary, and I look forward to hearing what you suggest.”

Q. How to recover when you already shared your expected salary?
“I have learned a lot more about the company, the position, and the compensation package since I gave that initial salary range. Given what I’ve learned, I would be more comfortable at [your counteroffer].”



Here’s the question again:

Q. “So where are you right now in terms of salary, and what are you looking for if you make this move?”

Level 1 answer
“I’m not comfortable sharing my current salary. I would prefer to focus on the value I can add to this company rather than what I’m paid at my current job. I don’t have a specific number in mind for a desired salary, and you know better than I do what value my skillset and experience could bring to your company. I want this move to be a big step forward for me in terms of both responsibility and compensation.”

If they keep pushing after that longer answer, you can shorten it up and try again:

“I’m just not comfortable discussing my current or expected salary. I prefer to focus on the value I can add in this position, and I look forward to hearing what you think is appropriate.”

Level 2 answer
If the Level 1 answer doesn’t quite work, it’s time to move on to Level 2, which requires a slightly more sophisticated answer:

“It sounds like you’re trying to qualify me for a salary range. If you want to tell me what that range is, I’m happy to tell you if it’s in the ballpark.”

And if that doesn’t work, you can reach for the trump card—the Level 3 answer…

Level 3 answer
“I’m not comfortable sharing my current employer’s proprietary compensation information, and I know they wouldn’t appreciate it if I did. I still work for them, and I’m just not comfortable sharing their proprietary information about how they pay people like me. I really don’t have a specific number in mind for an expected salary, and I look forward to hearing what you suggest.”

That should enable you to move on to the actual job interviews.
